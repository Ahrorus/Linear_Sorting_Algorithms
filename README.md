# Linear_Sorting_Algorithms

This projectsâ€™s purpose is to show the effectiveness of the three standard linear sorting algorithms.

> It consists of three applications (.jar files), to test counting, radix, and bucket sorting algorithms. For counting sort, it sorts a given array of numbers and proves the stability of the algorithm. For radix sort, it sorts a randomly generated array of hexadecimal numbers (hex-strings). For the bucket sort, it sorts a given array of numbers and proves the stability of the algorithm.

To run, open the command line in the project folder and type one of these three commands, one for each application.

For counting sort, run:
```bash
java -jar CountingSort.jar
```

For radix sort, run:
```bash
java -jar RadixSort.jar
```

For bucket sort, run:
```bash
java -jar BucketSort.jar
```

Note: the applications were compiled and built using Java SDK 11. The .jar files may not run in earlier versions of the SDK.
